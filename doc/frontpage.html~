<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://flens.sourceforge.net">FLENS</a>: 
Flexible Library for Efficient Numerical Solutions. The components of this 
library are the building blocks of TUNA, so you need to install and test it
before start using TUNA.


FLENS is a convenient and efficient C++ interface for BLAS and LAPACK, in 
such a way that is a very useful tool for the creation of serious scientific 
software in C++. FLENS requires a working BLAS and LAPACK 
implementation on your system, and the CBLAS interface for BLAS.
There exist different BLAS and LAPACK implementations, the two tested and
recommended so far are:
<ul> 
<li> <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net">ATLAS</a> and 
 <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a>,
<li>
<a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/307757.htm">
Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL).</a>
</ul>

<li> 
<a href="http://libkdtree.alioth.debian.org/">libkdtree++</a> is an 
STL-like C++ template container implementation of k-dimensional space 
sorting, using a kd-tree. The source of this library is included with TUNA,
so you do not need to install it at all.


</ul>

Installation

The next environment variables need to be modified according to your
system. These variables are defined in the file examples/rules.in

<ul>
 <li> FLENS: path to the FLENS library, as installed in your system.
 <li> ATLAS: path to the ATLAS library, as installed in your system.
 <li> RBF: path where the TUNA library will be installed.
</ul>


Post-procesing

You can plot the results using GNUplot. If you are using -DWITH_GNUPLOT 
in your compiling flags, then gnuplot is launched automatically during
the execution of every example.
