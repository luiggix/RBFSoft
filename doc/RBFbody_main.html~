TUNA::RBF is a set of template functions, classes and namespaces for 
numerically solving Partial Differential Equations using Radial 
Basis Functions Mesh-free methods. It also can be used to interpolate 
scattered data. Currently this library contains:

<ul>
<li> Kernels (1D, 2D and 3D)
  <ul>
          <li> Multiquadric (MQ)
          <li> Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
  </ul> 
<li> Solvers for linear systems
  <ul>
          <li> Gauss elimination
          <li> GMRES 
  </ul>
<li> Preconditioners
  <ul>
          <li> Jacobi
          <li> Approximated Cardinal Basis Functions
  </ul>
<li> Classes for point generation in different shapes
  <ul>
          <li> Rectangle
          <li> Semicircles
	  <li> Boxes
	  <li> Sub-domains for DD (rectangles)
  </ul>
<li> KDTree algorithm from libkdtree++.
</ul>


<h2>Quick instructions for the impatient</h2>

<ul>
<li> Install BLAS and LAPACK
<li> Install FLENS
<li> Unpack TUNA::RBF
<li> Go to the examples directory.
  <ul> 
    <li> Modify rules.in and rulesMPI.in files.
    <li> compile and execute each example to 
     get used to the components of TUNA::RBF.
    <li> For more info about the examples click on the 
<a href="./files.html">Files</a> tab of the above menu.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://flens.sourceforge.net">FLENS</a>: 
Flexible Library for Efficient Numerical Solutions. The components of this 
library are the building blocks of TUNA::RBF, so you need to install and test it
before start using TUNA::RBF.


FLENS is a convenient and efficient C++ interface for BLAS and LAPACK, in 
such a way that is a very useful tool for the creation of serious scientific 
software in C++. FLENS requires a working BLAS and LAPACK 
implementation on your system, and the CBLAS interface for BLAS.
There exist different BLAS and LAPACK implementations, the two tested and
recommended so far are:
<ul> 
<li> <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net">ATLAS</a> and 
 <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a>,
<li>
<a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/307757.htm">
Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL).</a>
</ul>

<li> 
<a href="http://libkdtree.alioth.debian.org/">libkdtree++</a> is an 
STL-like C++ template container implementation of k-dimensional space 
sorting, using a kd-tree. The source of this library is included with TUNA::RBF,
so you do not need to install it at all.


</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

TUNA::RBF source code is completely in the headers, so the only libraries you
need to compile and to install are FLENS and a flavor of BLAS and LAPACK.
Once installed the requirements, all you need to do is to unpack TUNA::RBF
and to define the next environment variables according to your
system. These variables are in the files examples/rules.in and 
examples/rulesMPI.in (modify both of them).

<ul>
 <li> FLENS: path to the FLENS library, as installed in your system.
 <li> ATLAS: path to the ATLAS library, as installed in your system.
 <li> RBF: path where the TUNA::RBF library will be installed (unpacked).
</ul>

Now go to the examples subdirectory and compile (make) and execute each
example. Please read the documentation of every example (click on the Files
tab of the html documentation for a complete explanation of the examples).

<h2>Compiler Options</h2>

<ul>
<li> -DNDEBUG : used for FLENS to avoid bounds check and other
debugging stuff. When used the performance is drastically improved.
<li> -DWITH_GNUPLOT : to launch GNUplot during the execution of
the examples.
<li> -D_1D_ : for 1D problems (could be deprecated in the future).
<li> -D_2D_ : for 2D problems (could be deprecated in the future).
<li> -D_3D_ : for 3D problems (could be deprecated in the future).
<li> -DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK : for compiling MPI-C++ bindings.
</ul>

<h2>Post-procesing</h2>

The results of the examples are written in ASCII format and can be plotted directly using
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">GNUplot</a>. If you are using 
-DWITH_GNUPLOT in your compiling flags, then gnuplot is launched 
automatically during the execution of every example. To use this feature
be sure you have installed GNUplot in your system.
