These programs were the first tries to solve the Lid-Driven Cavity problem, 
some things are no well understood and the code is not clean. Also, the 
static approach is used and a tiny under-relaxation parameter is really 
important for all cases, even for Reynolds = 0, otherwise the program doesn't
converge. Both programas, lid_driven0.cpp and lid_driven1.cpp read their 
initial data from the "input" file.
